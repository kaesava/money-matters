We are now going to do something similar with other screens in the web app to ensure that the corresponding mobile app screen is equivalent in functionality and re-uses user-facing literals.

# Rules
* Strict adherence to AGENTS.md
* As you build code, you decide whether you want to run pnpm typecheck/lint/test/test coverage/i8ln-check/install/ for the modules you want. However, at the end, ensure pnpm validate runs successfully. Because pnpm validate is made up of multiple commands, just run the commands that failed sequentially until all of them pass, then try pnpm validate again. If it fails, repeat by running just the failed commands and then by running pnpm validate again. Once successful, commit code, but ask me before pushing the code.
* Ensure that if there are schema changes, push both to dev and prod db, and if seed updates needed, push seed to both dev and prod (both environments currently only have dummy data - safe to overwrite)
* If you see issues with the web application, ask me before making changes. I want to focus on getting the mobile app ready for now.
* Each of the requested changes may require a deep-dive into the code - optimise how you do this, but be prepared to go deep for 100% coverage.
* If there are capabilities that you detect in the web app that have not been built in the mobile app as you review the screen, notify me and ask if I want that built, but of course, you will always use native mobile UI/UX
* Mobile app must re-use as much UX as possible, defining UI elements centrally and re-using.
* If you need clarity, /grill-me.
* I don't need walkthrough at the end'
* Output: Detail implementation plan - including db push for dev & prod and if any seed adjustment, then seed push to dev and prod.
* Important: Do not create new en.ts keys unless absolutely necessary. Re-use keys. Ensure consistent user facing literal keys used across mobile and web apps.

# Rules
* Strict adherence to AGENTS.md including no hardcoding of user facing literals, keeping SCHEMA DFINITION, FUNCTIONAL & Technical Specs md current, NO hardcoding user facing literals, vertical slice architecture, O dead/redundant tables/table fields/API code/UI code/capability code/other package code/etc, ensure UI elements, look-and-feel, colour, UI styling, etc is defined once and re-used, MECE principle for re-use of logic/screens/modals/etc., test cases coverage, etc.
* As you build code, you decide whether you want to run pnpm typecheck/lint/test/test coverage/i8ln-check/install/ for the modules you want. However, at the end, ensure pnpm validate runs successfully.

* Each of the requested changes may require a deep-dive into the code - optimise how you do this, but be prepared to go deep for 100% coverage.
* Ensure that the mobile app and web app functionality are kept aligned functionally, but always using native UI/UX

# MOBILE
Testing on Android Google Pixel 10.

## Mobile Login Data Fetching & Tenant Hydration: COMPLETED
* Fixed `TypeError: contextMap[utilName] is not a function` proxy crash in `switchActiveTenant`.
* Guarded all mobile queries with `enabled: !!session?.user` to prevent unauthenticated 401 cache locking.
* Resolved immediate tenant hydration on login without premature local storage wipes.

## Pools: COMPLETED
* Fully aligned with `/dashboard/pools` web functionality.
* Move Money consolidated to QuickActionModal transfer tab.
* Overflow menu with Recalibrate Household Budget & View Archived Pools.
* Chip filtering and SearchInput.
* CategoryFormModal field ordering, calculated target notices, and surplus targets aligned.

# FUNCTIONAL AUDIT

### 2. Lead Business Analyst (V1 Functional Completeness)
* Identify all the Apps Capabilities (partially listed below), and ensure there are 0 Functional Gaps (Built per spec), no edge cases, no Code bugs, no duplicated code where code can be fully or partially reused, no inconsistencies, no friction UX, no misaligment with functional specs (allowing for the functional specs to not be current & complete), no logic flaws especially at the edges, no redundant or unused code, no dangerous or poor code, etc.

### General
* Connection interrupted message - validity, retry
* Behaviour of tables across the web app (sort, search, pagination, skeleton loading, reasonable widths, etc.
