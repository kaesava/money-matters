# AGENT - In progress...


_________


# Rules
* Strict adherence to AGENTS.md including no hardcoding of user facing literals, keeping FUNCTIONAL & Technical Specs md current, NO hardcoding user facing literals, vertical slice architecture, O dead/redundant tables/table fields/API code/UI code/capability code/other package code/etc, ensure UI elements, look-and-feel, colour, UI styling, etc is defined once and re-used, MECE principle for re-use of logic/screens/modals/etc., test cases coverage, etc.
* As you build code, you decide whether you want to run pnpm typecheck/lint/test/test coverage/i8ln-check/install/ for the modules you want. However, at the end, ensure pnpm validate runs successfully. Because pnpm validate is made up of multiple commands, just run the commands that failed sequentially until all of them pass, then try pnpm validate again. If it fails, repeat by running just the failed commands and then by running pnpm validate again. Once successful, commit code, but ask me before pushing the code.
* Ignore mobile app
* Make multiple passes if needed - as there may be cross-dependencies you'll miss if you don't
* Be critical, think deep
* /Grill-me when in doubt or there are unclear or conflicting asks.
* OUtput - detailed implementation plan that can be unambiguously carried out by a low token agent. No need for reports.

# ME to Do (AI to ignore)

## App Shakeout & QA Task List (Web & Mobile)

### Phase 1: Authentication & Onboarding
 Sign Up / Sign In: Register new account on Web (/sign-up) and Mobile. Verify redirect to /setup. Test invalid password & duplicate email edge cases.


### Phase 2: Core Budgeting & Waterfall
 Dashboard Metrics: Confirm monetary amounts render in JetBrains Mono font. Verify Total Income, Committed Bills Pool, Free Everyday, and Savings totals.
 Deficit Repair Edge Case: Set upcoming expense higher than available income -> verify 5-step waterfall deficit repair highlights deficit in red (#ba1a1a).
 Category Management (/dashboard/categories): Create, edit, archive, and restore categories. Test "Move Money" modal between envelopes.

### Phase 3: Payday & Transactions
 Payday Cascade (/dashboard/paychecks): Preview & execute payday -> verify funds distribute across Bills, Everyday, and Buffer.
 CSV Import (Web): Upload sample bank CSV -> map columns -> verify transactions populate and envelope balances update.
 Reconciliation: Open Bank Account Reconciliation modal -> enter actual balance -> verify variance adjustment transaction created.

### Phase 4: Multi-Tenancy & Billing
 Partner Invites: Send invite from /dashboard/settings -> accept link /invite/[token] in incognito window -> verify second user sees shared tenant.
 Tenant Isolation (RLS): Attempt cross-tenant query -> verify PostgreSQL RLS blocks unauthorized access.
 Stripe Upgrade (/subscription/upgrade): Upgrade to Household plan using test card -> verify status updates to ACTIVE and /subscription/manage opens Customer Portal.

### Phase 5: Mobile Offline & Native UX
 Offline Mode: Enable Airplane mode -> view categories & transactions via local SQLite cache. Re-enable network -> verify sync.
 Quick Expense Modal: Add transaction via native numeric keypad -> verify smooth modal dismissal and list update.
